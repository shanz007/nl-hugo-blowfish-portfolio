**Smart Adaptive Interfaces** is a research-driven browser extension that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to dynamically modify web content for improved digital wellbeing. This project, team based one that I have worked with Nicholas and supervised by Dr Aku visuri.

The project addresses the overuse of digital technologies by implementing three adaptive interaction modes that allow users to **suppress, obscure, or highlight** web elements based on AI-identified distractions and dark patterns. Our mixed-methods study with 18 participants demonstrated that users preferred the **suppress mode** and valued the ability to toggle between modes, enhancing their sense of control over digital distractions.
